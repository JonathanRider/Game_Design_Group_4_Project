**PREREQUISITES**

- CMAKE (www.cmake.org)
- SFML 2.3.1 (www.sfml-dev.org)


**COMPILING**
(LINUX)
To make the compilation process easier for people downloading our game, we created a bash script called cm.sh.
First, you need to make it executable, so run
chmod 755 cm.sh
Then simply run
./cm.sh
This will set the SFML environment variables, then it will run cmake, then it will run make.
Now, you can run the program.

(WINDOWS)
First, make sure sfml dll files are located in your system PATH. Make sure you have the dll's that go with the compiler you are using.
If the website doesn't have the precompiled version for your compiler, you can compile the dll's yourself.

**BONUS LEVELS**
The bonus levels with the other groups sprites can be accessed by going to level 9 and then going right.

**CLEANING UP**

If you want to remove all compiled files, just run 'make clean'.  This will remove every .o file and executable.  It will not however remove any of the files generated by CMake.
If you want to obtain a completely clean copy of your code, you can run the provided script 

(linux only): 'scripts/cmake_cleanup'
(both): Remove the following files/folders
	'CMakeCache.text'
	'cmake_install.cmake'
	'CMakeFiles'
	'MakeFile'
