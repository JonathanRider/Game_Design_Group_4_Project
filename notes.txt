add triggerComponent

maybe have the graphic component hold a name to the sprite not actually the
sprite so we don't have to have texture when we create an entity?
Or possibly load all of the textures into predetermined names when a level starts
before we create the entitys then use an enum

do we want entity manager to take in a pointer to an entity?

We should rethink using wall tiles, as the more wall tiles we have, the slower the vision cones work.(unless we implement a bsp tree to sort the walls by position and refactor the visio cones, which will not be fun)

Also, we should maybe think about splitting logicSystem up. Just from adding the vision cone code has made it huge. Or maybe we should just move grouped functions to different files?
