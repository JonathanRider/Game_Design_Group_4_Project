add triggerComponent

maybe have the graphic component hold a name to the sprite not actually the
sprite so we don't have to have texture when we create an entity?
Or possibly load all of the textures into predetermined names when a level starts
before we create the entitys then use an enum

do we want entity manager to take in a pointer to an entity?
